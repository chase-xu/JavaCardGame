Greetings,

Tried to fix some bugs, but the more I implement the more bugs came out. really need more time to do it. I have tried to do some bounces, but it generates a lost of bugs, so 
I just delete those bonues and give up.
Sorry for the late due, really had a lot of work since this year( got to feed myself).
There is one problem is that, once one player played the other player know what played correctly but on the player who played's canvas wrong cards displayed.

The only line Argument I have is for the host arddress.

Thank you very much.
